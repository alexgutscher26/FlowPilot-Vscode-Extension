## Features

- **Code Explanations**: Get line-by-line explanations of your Python code
- **Error Analysis**: Understand what errors mean, why they occur, and how to fix them
- **Code Reviews**: Learn about code quality, style improvements, and best practices
- **Proactive Learning**: Detects when you're stuck and offers contextual help
- **Privacy-First**: Anonymous telemetry with explicit user consent
