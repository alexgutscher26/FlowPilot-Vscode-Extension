# Implementation Plan: Code Coach VS Code Extension

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Code Coach VS Code extension into discrete, manageable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally toward a complete teaching-focused extension that explains code, analyzes errors, and provides code quality reviews. The implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation between VS Code integration, API communication, UI rendering, and user interaction detection.

## Notes

- All tasks are required for comprehensive development including full testing coverage
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property-based tests validate universal correctness properties using fast-check
- Unit tests focus on specific examples, edge cases, and integration points
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and provide opportunities for user feedback
- The implementation prioritizes safety (no file modifications) and privacy (anonymous telemetry only)
