# Welcome to FlowPilot! 🦖

I'm excited to introduce **FlowPilot** - your AI-powered coding companion that lives right inside VS Code.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Problem

As developers, we've all been there:
- Staring at legacy code wondering "what does this even do?"
- Debugging cryptic error messages for hours
- Context-switching to ChatGPT or Stack Overflow constantly
- Wishing we had a senior developer to explain things

## The Solution

FlowPilot brings the power of Large Language Models directly into your editor. No more context switching, no more copy-pasting code into ChatGPT.

### Key Features

**💡 Explain Selection**
Highlight any code snippet and get instant, step-by-step explanations. Perfect for understanding complex algorithms or unfamiliar libraries.

**🐞 Error Coach**
Stuck on a bug? FlowPilot analyzes error messages, explains the root cause, and suggests fixes—all within VS Code.

**📝 Code Reviews**
Get on-demand code reviews that check for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues before you commit.

**📊 Session Analytics**
Track your coding sessions and visualize your progress over time via the web dashboard.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! We're working on:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for codebase-wide context
- Local LLM support for privacy-focused developers
- Integration with project management tools (Jira, Linear)
- Advanced refactoring suggestions

## Get Started

Install FlowPilot from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowpilot.flowpilot) and start coding smarter today!

```bash
code --install-extension flowpilot.flowpilot
```
