result = calculate_area(5)
print(f"Area: {result}")
```

**To test:**
1. Select the code above
2. Right-click → "Code Coach: Explain Selected Code"
3. View the explanation in the Code Coach sidebar panel

### 2. Code Review

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    total = total + numbers[i]
print(total)
```

**To test:**
1. Select the code above
2. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → "Code Coach: Review Selected Code"
3. See suggestions for improvements

### 3. Error Explanation
```python
# This code has an intentional error
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**
- Make sure you're in a Python file (`.py` extension)
- Check that Demo Mode is enabled in settings
- Ensure the Code Coach sidebar is open (🎓 icon in Activity Bar)
- Try reloading VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window")

**No explanations showing?**
- Ensure the Code Coach sidebar panel is visible (🎓 icon in Activity Bar)
- Check the VS Code Developer Console for errors (`Help` → `Toggle Developer Tools`)

**Sidebar not loading?**
- Look for the 🎓 (graduation cap) icon in the Activity Bar (left side of VS Code)
- If missing, try reloading the window or reinstalling the extension
- Check that the extension is properly activated for Python files

**Want to see the mock responses?**
- Open VS Code Developer Console
- Look for `[Demo Mode]` log messages showing the mock API calls
